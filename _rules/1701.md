All identifiers (such as types, type members, parameters and variables) should be named using words from the Australia English language.

- Choose easily readable, preferably grammatically correct names. For example, `HorizontalAlignment` is more readable than `AlignmentHorizontal`.
- Favor readability over brevity. The property name `CanScrollHorizontally` is better than `ScrollableX` (an obscure reference to the X-axis).
- Avoid using names that conflict with keywords of widely used programming languages.
